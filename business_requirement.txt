Backend (Python): Flask/FastAPI for the web server, scikit-learn for core ML algorithms, pandas/numpy for data manipulation, Dask/Spark for scalability.

Frontend (Web UI): React/Vue/Angular for interactive UI, D3.js/Plotly/Altair for visualizations, a drag-and-drop library (e.g., React Flow, jsPlumb).

Packaging: Setuptools for pip package, Poetry/PDM for dependency management.

This detailed requirement set should provide a solid foundation for developing the enterprise-level clustering solution.
